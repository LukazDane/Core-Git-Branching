## Plot

George woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an eggs he left for school.
Normally George would have walked down Bleaker streat, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.

Being on time was not one of George’s specialities today would prove to be no different. He moved slowly. As he walked behind the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell he could see the trees and thick floiage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.

George had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell wall was ajar.

Normally George would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell cashier but got no response. He was busy refilling the sour cream pit at the behest of his ruler!
The smell of the of the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

George met Princess Celestia who granted him magic powers.
The end.
